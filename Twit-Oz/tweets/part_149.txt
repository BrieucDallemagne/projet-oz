Congratulations to @KingJames on winning Athlete of the Year in last night’s @ESPYS. LeBron is also a great guy!
Go to @Macys now to see the incredible new selection of Trump Signature Collection ties shirts and suits.
@rhino848484 My honor.
.@GOP congress needs to actually defund ObamaCare not waste time passing non-binding resolutions.
Why is the @GOP congress focusing on amnesty when so many Americans are unemployed?
Time is on your side; things do not continue downward forever. - Think Big
Isn't it crazy that people of little or no talent or success can be so critical of those whose accomplishments are great with no retribution
Don't talk about Rolling Stone Magazine but most importantly don't buy it. This degenerate killed and maimed so many wonderful people!
Sad thing is Rolling Stone was (is) a dead magazine with big downward circulation and now for them at last people are talking about it!

The Zimmerman trial is over.  It is time to move on.  While Zimmerman is no angel he was acquitted and should be able to move on.
.@IsraeliPM @netanyahu is a resolute leader.  When he sets a red line it stands!
.@MissUSA Erin Brady is doing a fantastic job representing Trump Miss USA.  Smart gorgeous--a really positive force!
The 2013 Trump @MissUniverse Pageant comes to Moscow on November 9th.  Airing from Crocus City Hall on @nbc!
Only in America can a Jihadi thug who murdered women and children be nursed back to health &amp; then get a @RollingStone cover.
@B3kz0r  Many people agree!
@Preppermeister @EastsideRJ  Thanks.
.@jacknicklaus has done a GREAT job as the architect of my new golf course at Ferry Point. NYC is very proud!
@CMCoe Have fun!
@francaselles  Thank you.
Fun fact for my 2M+ followers - the 'Architect' Karl Rove blew $400M in the 2012 election with a success rate of 1.6%.
Mariano Rivera is one of top @Yankees of all time. Greatest closer of all time. A true warrior. Last night's MVP award well-deserved.
@JocelynClervil @ESPN_Colin  Thanks.
@espnradio My great honor!
@jrmarsy Rolling Stone is just another dying magazine that sucks!

@MysticWolf12001 Thanks.
@jonyeong Don't be a fool.
Weiner and Spitzer are on top of the latest polls.  A sad day for the greatest city on earth! They will spend lots of time together.
@AustinSaysThat True!
@JesusSoGameeer I promise.
@ugolf_ross Perhaps. Pray for great leadership!
@ajshaw1003 Great!
@ADuanePotter Do not give up--you will make it!
@not_that_actor  Interesting!
Traitor Snowden has requested asylum in Russia.  Why would Russia grant it?  Snowden already gave them all the intel he stole!

Now A-Rod doesn’t even show up to his single-A rehab games.  Maybe the @Yankees will get lucky and @MLB will suspend A-Rod.
Be careful – sexting pervert Anthony Weiner is upping his campaigning.  When will new pictures be released?
Eliot Spitzer’s illegal frivolous &amp; over reaching harassment of Hank Greenberg at AIG played a major part in 2008 financial meltdown.
All NYC needs is the mentally unstable Elliot Spitzer in office again.
@HelenPferdehirt Thanks Helen
Zimmerman is no angel but the lack of evidence and the concept of self-defense especially in Florida law gave the jury little other choice
@fordbeautyqueen   Thanks.
Spitzer failed as A.G. failed as Governor in disgrace and was fired on all T.V. shows (boring and zero ratings) and he's at it again!
I would invite Edward Snowden to be a judge at the Miss Universe Pageant in Moscow but would be concerned that he would sell results early!
@EvanSMSolutions   Good luck!
Perhaps Miss USA can lure Snowden back?
I wonder if traitor Edward Snowden will be attending the Miss Universe Pageant in Moscow on November 9th.
Russia should hand over Snowden to the U.S. but they are having too much fun taunting our leaders.
@rockster62   Wow!
