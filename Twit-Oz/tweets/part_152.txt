We are being embarrassed by Russia and China on Snowden (and much more) yet Obama is talking about global warming on Tuesday.
@ARMusicPlanner Happy Birthday Anthony
@pbanura or Ireland?
@TrumpPhillyGM @DavisCPAGroup @TrumpPhillyPro  Have fun!
@BestNewProduct @TrumpCollection  Thanks it is a beautiful city.
@EWErickson Enjoy your stay!
@caroleapple   Great meeting you!

Change is the law of life. And those who look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future. John F. Kennedy
@WWEfan123444  Good luck.
Putin says Russia can’t allow a weakening of its nuclear deterrent—U.S. wants to reduce—are we crazy?
@CosmicShiftBar @I_Am_Optimistic Thanks.
@BarriMedia Good luck.
@fubaglady @CamaroDays  Thanks I do and will!
@KJLLeonard Thanks!
Due diligence includes increasing your financial IQ daily.
The best investors are visionaries—they look beyond the present.
Vision remains vision until you focus do the work and bring it down to earth where it will do some good.
After one of the great chokes in the history of sports it will be hard for the Spurs to beat the Heat - but who knows. Good game on now!
My people caught the person who committed "forgery" of the James Gandolfini-Obama Care phoney quote attributed to me-fraud. Arrest coming?
Re negotiation: Trust your instincts even after you've honed your skills. They're there for a reason.
@rtwing1020  Thanks--it will be great.
Keep focused on your goals. Practice positive thinking. View any conflict as an opportunity--look at the solution not the problem.
Negotiation is persuasion more than power. Negotiation includes a lot of fine lines--and that's what makes it an art.
Our debt is about to reach $17T. Iraq has $20T in oil reserves. Interesting.
@DannyZuker Loser Danny is obsessed with Trump.
We know who did the hoax of James Gandolfini and ObamaCare. Be careful Mister.
James Gandolfini was a remarkable talent.  He was also a decent man.  We will all miss him.
“Keep your brand standard in mind and your expansion will seem possible as well as gratifying.” – Midas Touch
Some dope said I deleted a tweet about James G. There was no tweet and there was no delete-a totally fabricated story (nobody saw tweet).
Who would really believe I would say such a thing about a guy I truly liked James Gandolfini.  Sadly very sick people use my name.
I never made the ridiculous comment about James G. and Obama Care - somebody else put it out and attributed it to me. Not my style!
@Matglav @IvankaTrump @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr  Thank you.
I salute all Tea Party Patriots for marching on DC today.  Stand strong!
Great to see @SarahPalinUSA back on @FoxNews. She's a wonderful woman and commentator.
.@Ed_Klein’s book ‘The Amateur’ is out in paper back.  Lots of insights.
@TheBigAStabile   So true.
@tubby511 Thank you!
@LongLiveTheBOSS   Thank you very nice!
Amazing comeback by The Heat - your friends at your favorite golf club Trump National Doral are proud of you. NOW for game 7!
Watch the game-really good.
Great basketball game going on right now!
Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow - if so will he become my new best friend?
The Miami Heat is getting it's ass kicked - they better start playing or it will be a long Summer for them.
The Miss Universe Pageant will be broadcast live from MOSCOW RUSSIA on November 9th. A big deal that will bring our countries together!
I met a Trump Twitter hater last night (well known). As he came near me he nervously said "Mr. Trump it is an honor to meet you sir!" Nice
Young entrepreneurs – never back down. Take the hits and get up.  That’s what makes a winner.
Keep testing your limits. Never become complacent.  Always think big!
All I can say is that if I were President Snowden would have already been returned to the U.S. (by their fastest jet) and with an apology!
Snowden is doing great damage to our relations with other countries and U.S.prestige. China is laughing at us as he continues illegal action
Snowden is sitting in China and taunting the U.S. He is mocking us as a Country. Great time to place a tax on China trade if not turned over
Like it or not haters and losers everybody is talking about Miss U.S.A. and Miss Utah. By the way she is a fine young woman-unfair to her.
Frankly for a writer I don’t think @DannyZuker’s stuff is good. In fact it’s terrible.
I own @DannyZuker but he has his friends &amp; haters &amp; losers tweeting that he beat me. He can’t beat me at anything!
A country that does not control or respect its own borders is a country destined for failure. Secure our borders!
Trending story on Miss Utah is very unfair. She simply lost her train of thought—could happen to anyone! @MissUSA  @MissUniverse
Congratulations to @EmilyMiller @mboyle1 &amp; @NolteNC on making @FishbowlDC’s list of "10 Journos You Don't Want to Fight on Twitter."
.@GiulianaRancic &amp; @nickjonas both did a wonderful job hosting @MissUSA! Everyone loved @JonasBrothers &amp; @DJPaulyD’s performances!
Congratulations to Connecticut’s Erin Brady on being crowned the 2013 @MissUSA! America will be well-represented in @MissUniverse!
A family in Las Vegas just stopped a violent home invasion by shooting one of the perpetrators-the other fled and will be captured. Great!
We should stay the hell out of Syria the "rebels" are just as bad as the current regime. WHAT WILL WE GET FOR OUR LIVES AND $ BILLIONS?ZERO
Happy Father's Day to all even the haters and losers!
@LeoDiCaprio   Come to Miss U.S.A. tomorrow in Las Vegas-will be a great evening!

@DuchessofDallas  Thanks Anna.
.@GiulianaRancic &amp; @nickjonas are co-hosting Miss USA 2013 -- Sunday night at 9 PM ET on NBC. @JonasBrothers will be performing. Tune in!
.@IvankaTrump and I are looking forward to visiting Vancouver next week.  Big announcement…
Still a great time to buy residential property.  The courts are holding up foreclosures.  Buy directly from the banks.
It’s Thursday.  How much has OPEC ripped us off today?
Challenges present opportunities.  Always keep your focus and stay calm.
Thanks to everyone for your kind birthday wishes -- very nice!
@Teerellz_95   You have no chance!
@Sir_KLZA  Hater Danny is getting his ass kicked like he has all of his life!
@wfdelong   Now tell the truth.
Just tried watching Modern Family - written by a moron really boring. Writer has the mind of a very dumb and backward child. Sorry Danny!
@WhiskeySam99  .Sam you are so pathetic!
Lightweight @DannyZuker is too stupid to see that China (and others) is destroying the U.S. economically and our leaders are helpless! SAD.
Is it a coincidence that the Middle East has blown up since Obama became president?
Why isn’t the @GOP congress doing everything possible to defund and cut ObamaCare?
Age wrinkles the body. Quitting wrinkles the soul. - General Douglas MacArthur
I can't resist hitting lightweight @DannyZuker verbally when he starts up because he is just.so pathetic and easy (stupid)!
.@DannyZuker  Danny--You're a total loser!
Looking forward to speaking at @ralphreed’s @FaithandFreedom Gala Dinner on Friday in D.C. His staff has been great!
@scottymcd1980 Have fun and thanks.
.@DannyZuker Danny—Let your bosses on Modern Family lend you the money to play the game.  Show courage!
If Snowden was such a hero then he would be in America.  He is escaping justice!
I've been warning about China since as early as the 80’s. No one wanted to listen. Now our country is in real trouble. #TimetoGetTough
Wow sexual assaults in the military have gone through the roof far worse than anybody could have predicted!
@lovevictoria   Happy birthday Victoria.
@MatthewJPizzo  Thanks Matt!
Amazing… @VattenfallGroup tried to destroy Aberdeen.
