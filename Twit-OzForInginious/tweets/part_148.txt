Druggie @AROD is now scheming to sue the @Yankees. He will go down as the biggest sports embarrassment of all time.
Wacko pervert @AnthonyWeiner’s idea of Hispanic outreach is using Carlos Danger as his sexting. He’s an insensitive racist.

Our GDP has been growing less than 2% for the last 5 years.  ObamaCare will slow us down even more.  Has to be repealed.
