Nominating Chuck Hagel for SOD is the wrong move for Obama.  He doesn’t need the fight.  Too much political capital will be wasted.
I hope the Republicans are happy.  Just as I predicted that stupid deal they voted for only whetted Obama’s appetite for more taxes.

Just shows that you can have all the cards and lose if you don’t know what you’re doing.
I’ll bet Obama now uses the amendment for the debt ceiling.
@sldewey  But a bad one!
@MS2202  True and true!
@lovebn40  Thanks Heidi.

@firefergee  Perhaps so!
@CambriaCravy  I told you so!
@GrantGill  Thanks
@alancravey  That is something to think about isn't it!
@MarkGhuneim  Something used on occasion by many of the world's greatest businessmen.
The Trump Organization is going revolutionize Rio de Janeiro’s downtown port area with Trump Towers. Construction begins soon!
Republicans had all the cards but not the guts to make a great deal!
Great to see Sec. Clinton leaving the hospital yesterday with @ChelseaClinton and Pres. Clinton.  Glad she is recuperating.
So Obama and Congress can waste billions in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan building roads &amp; schools but can’t get money to the NJ &amp; NY Sandy victims?
The Republicans look so weak and foolish—what the hell are they doing?
@jamesche85  Dopey I never went bankrupt.

@mimi_187  Mimi--perhaps because they are losers.
@SarahB205 I get you!
@jamesche85  I do complain.
@DrJoySchaffer I fully understand your question.
@maverick1195 Thanks I think!
I can't believe Republican leadership allowed such a stupid deal to be made. They are rapidly giving up all of their cards.
@Skyhawk442  Yes and I am Presbyterian.
@vikinggroup1  True!
@PRDay Wilson--but he probably won't get it.
@jimmyscissor  Isn't that so true! And by the millions.
@prince1fares A total mess!

This ‘deal’ @RNC voted for has $41 in tax increases for every $1 in spending cuts.  It is pathetic.  Obama is laughing at them.
Make sure you realize that this ‘deal’ is only a stop gap measure.Obama will be looking to raise even more taxes in the coming negotiation..
...Remember--I told you so.
Obama's deal raises taxes on 77% of national households.  With Obama Care taxes kicking in now everyone will be paying for his 2nd term.
.@GOP’s election loss and failed negotiations will serve as a case study in how third parties come about.
The Republicans must face reality &amp; create a strong &amp; positive immigration policy--if not they will continue to lose elections.

Does any Republican have the ability to negotiate?
This is a terrible deal for the country and an embarrassment for Republicans!
Maybe Boehner will stop this one sided deal in the House...I hope so!
What is Mitch McConnell thinking?...make the big deal!
I am a Republican...but the Republicans may be the worst negotiators in history!
Obama and the Democrats are laughing at the deal they just made...the Republicans got nothing!
@opus_6  Thanks it's a wonderful place to be--and Happy New Year.
