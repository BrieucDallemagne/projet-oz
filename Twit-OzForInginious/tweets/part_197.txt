I always said @BarackObama will attack Iran in some form prior to the election.
.@Israel could very well be close to attacking Iran. Could be this election's big October surprise...
Jennifer Aniston is engaged--she's a great person and I wish her well.
There are only 22 days for @BarackObama to drop @JoeBiden. Obama is not a loyal guy. I think he is strongly considering it.
I still hold the all-time attendance and pay per view record at @WWE.
Congratulations to @WWERaw on passing 1000 episodes. @WWE is still going strong after all these years--@VinceMcMahon is great!

Certain Internet sites are like a bad epidemic that won't go away---others are terrific

The Huffington Post is such a loser--it will die just as AOL is dying What a stupid deal AOL made to buy it!

While @JoeBIden is a gaffe machine yesterday's comments that @MittRomney will "put y'all back in chains" was not at all proper.
Nobody wants wind turbines they are failing all over the world and need massive subsidy--a disaster for taxpayers.
.@BarackObama is promoting ugly inefficient unreliable bird-killing noisy neighborhood-destroying wind turbines. Big mistake.

.@lolojones given a raw deal in @nytimes story--not fair.
I will be speaking the night before the RNC in Sarasota FL when I receive the "Statesman of the Year" award.
As we told the @nydailynews I was asked to speak at the RNC but said no because I will be doing something much bigger--just watch!
The failing New York Daily News knowingly incorrectly reported that I wanted to speak at the Republican National Convention--wrong!
All recent Presidents have released their transcripts. What is @BarackObama hiding?
Received a beautiful letter from Joe Paterno's son Jay. He really loved and respected his father.

I always enjoy being interivewed on @WOR710 by John Gambling. My father Fred used to listen to his father's show.
Our major airports are decaying. It's embarrassing. We need to have them renovated by competent professionals--and fast.
The NYPost reports "@VanityFair Magazine dropped 18% to only 283938 newsstand copies sold." Very sad &amp; their bloggers are doing even worse!
.@HuffingtonPost is doing very badly. Also very inaccurate stories. Like AOL when will they fail?

Looking forward to meeting the great folks of Sarasota GOP party when I am honored as 'Statesman of the Year.' Should be a wonderful time.

I went to @MikeTyson's play. I will be doing a review in the next #trumpvlog.
Glad to hear Clint Eastwood endorsed @MittRomney. He understands that America needs a big boost to be strong again.
The Senate should be more concerned about actually passing a budget than spreading lies about @MittRomney's taxes.
The Fed should not do another 'stimulus.' We can't keep spending our children's future away on waste.
.@MittRomney will create 2 million new jobs if elected POTUS.  If reelected @BarackObama will create over $12T in new debt. Easy choice.
