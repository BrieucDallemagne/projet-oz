Immigration reform really changes the voting scales for the Republicans—for the worse!
Re: immigration. Do the Republicans not realize that Dems will get 100% of 11 million votes no matter what they do?

Had a great time on the @HowardStern show this morning—he will and should never change!

Then ask: What am I pretending not to see? These two simple questions can pave the way for some very clear answers.
