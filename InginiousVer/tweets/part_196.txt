A fact--golfers don't get aches &amp; pains like others who don't golf. It is amazingly remedial.
Of course @hardball_chris attacked 'birthers' in praising @CondoleezzaRice's speech. Chris has completely lost it.
Letterman @Late_Show begging me to go back on his low rated show--calls lots--must apologize for racist comment.
I am impressed with how clearly @PaulRyanVP explains the challenges we face and the solutions @MittRomney will bring as President.
Book on Bin Laden is a terrible violation of code--makes @BarackObama's story a big lie.
I wonder what @JoeBiden was thinking last night as @PaulRyanVP delivered that knockout speech. Joe should call in sick for the VP debate.
After four  years of getting the run-around America needs a turnaround and the man for the job is Governor Mitt Romney. @PaulRyanVP
The dummies left Iraq (and Libya) without the oil!

Congratulations to @GovMikeHuckabee on last night's tremendous speech. Mike united the party faithful and explained that we can do better.
Only two weeks until we start shooting @CelebApprentice. We really have something amazing for the fans this year.
Gas prices are way too high. With an economy contracting and lower demand how do OPEC &amp; the speculators get away with this?!
It's Thursday and again I ask--how much money is China stealing from us?
I was putting together my early deals in New York &amp; I was advised by many that I was too young. Believe in yourself &amp; you can do anything.
I am astonished that the media continues to lie. @BarackObama gutted welfare reform. It is a fact!
America needs @MittRomney and @PaulRyanVP and we need them right now. -- @GovChristie
No one will work harder. No one will move heaven and earth like Mitt Romney to make this country a better place to live! -- @AnnDRomney
New business start-ups at the lowest level in 30 years and the EPA is now the Employment Prevention Agency. -- @bobmcdonnell

Great speech by my good friend @GovChristie. He did something you won't hear at @BarackObama's convention---tell the truth.
Congratulations to @AnnDRomney on delivering a knock out speech last night. America can't wait to call her our First Lady.
China must be worried that @MittRomney will win this November. They have never had such a pushover like @BarackObama.
.@BarackObama's dismal job record is reason alone that he must be defeated this November.

The Bay Bridge in San Francisco is being built by the Chinese--tremendous cost overruns. A total mess. We should build our own bridges etc
Don't think my statement on @ariannahuff was harsh if you knew her and the phony Huffington Post you would understand--- more to follow.
.@ariannahuff is unattractive both inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man- he made a good decision.
The US Navy wants to go "green." Our Navy should use the best &amp; most powerful fuel &amp; not play games. Give me a break!
As usual the weather people got it wrong in Tampa. They just look for headlines &amp; ratings!
Media silent when @BarackObama  called @MittRomney a murderer &amp; felon. Mitt mentions 'birth certificate' and they go nuts. Double standard!

Terrible tragedy at the Empire State Building today. Must have fast trials and death penalty for the animals.
.@lancearmstrong should immediately reconsider or his legacy is ruined.
I am very surprised that @lancearmstrong gave up. I never thought he was a quitter...

It's amazing how many people still come up to me to thank me for 'The Art of The Deal.' The book has changed a lot of lives.
I am tired of @BarackObama talking about @MittRomney's father. Why don't we discuss Barack Obama Sr.!
Only three weeks until the new season of @CelebApprentice begins filming--great all-star cast.
Glad to hear @BarackObama's attack ad featuring my plane is playing in North Carolina. Free ad time for Trump National in Charlotte!

Every economic climate whether an uptick or downturn presents new opportunities and challenges.
