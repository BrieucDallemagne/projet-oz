Raising the capital gains tax in this fragile economic time is the dumbest thing Washington could do.  So they will probably do it.

@WandaSalley  Thanks--have fun!

Once again Obama is going to lose on another prospective nomination. Chuck Hagel will not be named Sec. of Defense--&amp; probably shouldn't be.
Obama wants taxes to go up so he can take credit for lowering them next year.

Any deal completed before the fiscal curb must have tangible cuts on expenditures in baseline spending so we can get our credit back.
The Republicans once again hold all the cards with the debt ceiling.  They can get everything they want.  Focus!
@Limka11 @Jess_Wiliem98  Thank you.
Spolier alert…the record setting 13th season of All Star @CelebApprentice also features the return of previous winners in the boardroom.

Sorry to hear of yesterday’s passing of General Norman Schwarzkopf.  He was a terrific general and leader--we could use more like him.

Republicans remember—debt ceiling debt ceiling debt ceiling—be smart and you will win!
It’s Thursday.  How much time did Washington waste today trying to find a solution on the so-called fiscal cliff?
I told the Republicans the debt ceiling talks should come before election--&amp; we would have a Republican president—they wouldn’t listen.
I hate hearing after all of the hard work that @MittRomney never wanted to become President.
Back by popular demand the fabulous @LilJon returns to the record setting 13th season of All Star @CelebApprentice.  The fans love him!
When renovations are completed Trump National Doral will be the finest resort in the U.S.
Congratulations to @FLGovScott --- the state is really making progress --- and fast!
Watching these politicians trying to get a deal done is truly painful --- Republicans are in a much stronger position than they think.

How is @VanityFair editor Graydon Carter allowed to run bad food restaurant Beatrice Inn? Fire Graydon!
Washington is in total gridlock—no trust no leadership—very interesting!
Dopey @Rosie--I never went bankrupt--ABC already apologized to me for your stupid statement in the past--they didn't want a lawsuit.

@candicebazuin @BravoAndy @GiulianaRancic  They were both terrific!
@KrystianDior The Apprentice will be great!
When I bought the #MissUniverse pageant 13 years ago it was on life support...
...now it’s the “greatest pageant on earth”-- broadcast in 190 countries to 1 billion people—“hot!”
Ratings for #MissUniverse pageant were highest in 4 years. @NBC likes me (and I like them!)
@pokerswayne @VanityFair  Very wrong dopey!
@jbresson  Thanks Justin.
@RonCharles @VanityFair @KBAndersen  Which magazine went bust under Carter and as I predicted!
Congratulations to all the Trump 2012 #MissUniverse contestants who came from across the world. You did great and made us all proud!
@ellavdw  You have to love what you do--you need passion to succeed.
@JNorr11  Good reason for a celebration.

@rebamoreland @VanityFair  Great move!
@GrantRebhun   Hard work but fun.
@MoruaGabriel  Thanks!
@OXSapphireXO @VanityFair  No that dope Graydon Carter has hit on me for 25 years. His magazines always fail (see SPY)
@random5   You can and you will--work hard.
@KevinKuhn5 @VanityFair  Thanks Kevin I tell the truth.
@DanForsley @VanityFair  Wrong--Graydon Carter has no talent and looks like shit! Also his food sucks!
@GreenerAG  I agree on both counts!
@jimrobbins1973 @VanityFair  I don't. Graydon Carter sends it to me free!
Be sure to watch #MissUniverse tonight at 8PM on @nbc with its first simulcast on @Telemundo!
The #MissUniverse women totally blow away the Victoria’s Secret women!
Dummy Graydon Carter doesn't like me too much...great news. He is a real loser! @VanityFair
@mattwiemeri  Thanks!
If Sheena Monnin apologized for her mistake as she should have I would have treated her very nicely.
Sheena Monnin acted terribly...she got what she deserved!
