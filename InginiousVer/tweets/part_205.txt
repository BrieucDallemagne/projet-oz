@AmandaKnox is innocent.  Italian government should pay for this travesty.
Sadly Vanity Fair is a rapidly dying magazine. Needs new blood--and fast! Going the way of SPY Magazine.

I am increasingly concerned with the UN's ploy against @Israel this coming week and will monitor all events closely from Australia.
