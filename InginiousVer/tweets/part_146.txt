Obama has exempted businesses his staff and all of Congress from ObamaCare.  Why is he still forcing the monstrosity on the U.S.?
I will be on Greta @gretawire tonight at 10 PM on Fox News.
Re @TWC TimeWarner I am going to be switching many of my buildings to another service—this is ridiculous!
I missed the PGA Championship because it was not broadcast by TimeWarner @TWC. Why aren’t they giving subscribers major discounts?
The Patch a total loser for @AOL will be a good deal compared to @HuffingtonPost. @ariannahuff laughs at “stupid” Armstrong!
Congrats to @mboyle1 of @BreitbartNews  for exposing Jason Linkins of @HuffingtonPost as a lightweight dope who gives false information.
@RoyalStr8tFlush  Wow good competition!
Still a buyer’s market but somewhat fragile.  Be sure to calculate the risk of rising rates coming sooner than you think!
@JTFoxx @HuffingtonPost  I agree--@HuffingtonPost is going down with @AOL and Patch &amp; @ariannahuff hates Tim Armstrong.
@BlazeBluntsky Thanks.
@FlyinOSUBuckeye @comfynumb2012 @ForQ2 So true! Just a business tool used by the best! Ask Carl Warren etc.
@Andrew_Patrick @DCGovWeb @DCGovTwit  Deal done--too late dopey!
@rogergreig  Thanks.
Good.morning I'm going to work!
Not only is @Toure a racist (and boring) he's a really dumb guy!
@ariannahuff I would love to represent your husband-you would end up with nothing! And please don't call Tim Armstrong stupid and weak?
Did the poor but smart to leave ex-husband of @ariannahuff get any of the dollars she got for the use of his name in really stupid AOL deal?
The failing @HuffingtonPost and dopey @ariannahuff are writing so much false junk about me-they just can't get enough!  BE CAREFUL.
@sonnset2  He knows the best place!

@MatthewSmales1   Thank you!
I can't believe that in New York we can't watch the PGA Championsip on CBS. How    .much discount is Time Warner giving its customers?

Colin Montgomerie @montgomeriefdn You are not only a great golfer you are doing a great job of commentary @GolfChannel
First Minister @AlexSalmond will be destroying the beauty of Scotland with his insane desire for bird killing wind turbines.
.@AlexSalmond is making a truly stupid mistake by forcing ugly industrial wind turbines down Scotland’s throat –he's hated for it.
If the gov't shuts down it is because Obama wants to make working Americans buy ObamaCare while businesses and gov't are exempt.
FACT – the reason why Americans have to worry about a government shutdown is because Obama refuses to pass a budget.

In the latest poll Danger-Weiner’s numbers have sunk. I wonder how Carlos handled the stress? He is one whacko sicko sexter.

Sleepy eyes @chucktodd when looking at my financial filings should’ve said “Great job Mr. Trump Sir.”
Doesn’t dummy @chucktodd realize that when I considered running for president I filed financial papers showing unbelievable numbers.
Sleepy eyes @chucktodd—one of the dumbest voices in politics-- is angry that I’m doing @ThisWeekABC.
@SmuMom54 He should meet him &amp; beat him--but that doesn't look like it's going to happen.
@NY2DC_N_BACK @blackpoolsinger @piersmorgan Wrong Piers is smart &amp; tough and when you get to know him a really good guy--and loyal!
Obama should meet with Putin snd convince him to do what is good for the U.S.  It's called good dealmaking or simply leadership! Cajole.
