The many losers and haters never have the brains or stamina to become truly successful!

Idiot @billmaher always forgets to mention that I am suing him to collect the $5M for charity that he expressly offered.

Great to see @Yankees Captain Derek Jeter back on the field.  He will have another great season and make NYC proud again.
Listen and learn from others but make your own decisions. Use your instincts--you alone know where you want to go.
Be tenacious. Being tenacious means you're tough and patient at once--a formidable combination.
@KayWiggs  Thanks!
Jerry Buss was a great guy and friend. He will be missed!

If I’m the third most envied man in America the small group of haters and losers must be nauseas.
Wow—Family Feud said I am the third most envied man in America. I respectfully disagree—I am very modest.

@bryanbrager #1 = be passionate. If you love what you're doing success will follow. With passion discouragement can't take hold.
I never want someone working for me who doesn’t want to be there--and in the same way you shouldn’t want to be there either.

Remember if you don't promote yourself then no one else will! Likewise believe in yourself--or no one else will either.
Success is good. Success with significance is even better. Work on what you will be proud to be associated with--make your work count.
@Cynlanjoh Keep up the good work Cynthia.
@Preppermeister  Thanks and good luck.

I believe in free markets but allowing a merger of US Air &amp; American Airlines is totally ridiculous! Will control most of US market.
If US Air and American Airlines are allowed to merge we are back to the days of “monopoly.”
